# Arbihedron ðŸ”º

**High-frequency triangular arbitrage system for cryptocurrency and forex markets**

> **PAPER TRADING BY DEFAULT** - This system starts in simulation mode. No real trades are executed until you explicitly enable live trading and provide API keys with trading permissions.

Arbihedron automatically detects and exploits price discrepancies in currency pairs through circular trading paths (Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’A), capturing low-risk profit opportunities within single exchanges.

## Features

- **Triangular Arbitrage Detection** - Automatically discovers profitable circular trading paths
- **Real-time Market Scanning** - High-frequency price monitoring across multiple trading pairs
- **Multi-Exchange Support** - Works with Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and more (via CCXT)
- **Risk Management** - Built-in position sizing, slippage tolerance, and rate limiting
- **Paper Trading Mode** - Test strategies without risking real capital
- **Live Dashboard** - Beautiful real-time monitoring with Rich terminal UI
- **Backtesting Engine** - Test strategies on historical data
- **Automated Execution** - Fast order execution with minimal latency

## How It Works

Triangular arbitrage exploits price inefficiencies between three currency pairs:

```
BTC/USDT â†’ ETH/BTC â†’ ETH/USDT â†’ BTC/USDT
```

If the compound exchange rate after fees exceeds 1.0, there's a profit opportunity!

**Example:**
1. Start with 1 BTC
2. Trade BTC â†’ ETH at current rate
3. Trade ETH â†’ USDT at current rate  
4. Trade USDT â†’ BTC at current rate
5. End with 1.005 BTC (0.5% profit)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Exchange API keys (optional for paper trading)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theredplanetsings/Arbihedron.git
cd Arbihedron

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your settings:
```bash
# Exchange Configuration
EXCHANGE_NAME=binance
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Trading Parameters
MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD=0.5    # Minimum 0.5% profit
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=1000      # $1000 per trade
SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE=0.1      # 0.1% slippage

# Safety First!
ENABLE_PAPER_TRADING=true   # KEEP THIS TRUE FOR TESTING
```

### Running the Bot

**Paper Trading Mode (DEFAULT - Recommended for testing):**

The bot runs in **simulation mode** by default. No real money is at risk:
- Discovers real market opportunities
- Simulates trade execution
- Calculates potential profits
- No actual orders are placed

```bash
python main.py
```

**Simple Example:**
```bash
python examples.py
```

**Backtesting:**
```bash
python backtest.py
```

**CAUTION: Switching to LIVE Trading (Advanced Users Only):**

Only enable live trading after thorough testing:
1. Obtain API keys from your exchange with **trading permissions**
2. Set `ENABLE_PAPER_TRADING=false` in `.env`
3. Add your real `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`
4. Start with small position sizes
5. Monitor closely for the first 24 hours

## Usage Examples

### Basic Opportunity Scan

```python
import asyncio
from exchange_client import ExchangeClient
from arbitrage_engine import ArbitrageEngine

async def scan():
    exchange = ExchangeClient()
    engine = ArbitrageEngine(exchange)
    await engine.initialize()
    
    snapshot = await engine.scan_opportunities()
    
    for opp in snapshot.opportunities[:5]:
        print(f"{opp.path} - Profit: {opp.path.profit_percentage:.4f}%")
    
    exchange.close()

asyncio.run(scan())
```

### Full Bot with Dashboard

```python
from main import ArbihedronBot

async def run():
    bot = ArbihedronBot()
    await bot.run()

asyncio.run(run())
```

## Configuration Options

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `EXCHANGE_NAME` | Exchange to use (binance, coinbase, etc.) | binance |
| `MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD` | Minimum profit % to execute | 0.5 |
| `MAX_POSITION_SIZE` | Maximum USD per trade | 1000 |
| `SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE` | Expected slippage % | 0.1 |
| `ENABLE_PAPER_TRADING` | Paper trading mode | true |
| `MAX_TRADES_PER_HOUR` | Rate limit | 100 |

## Risk Management

- Success rate
- Total profit/loss
- Average profit per trade
- Average slippage
- Sharpe ratio

## Disclaimer

Cryptocurrency trading carries significant risk. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

**Key Risks:**
- Market volatility
- Execution delays (latency)
- Slippage exceeding estimates
- API failures
- Exchange downtime
- Network congestion

**Always:**
- Start with paper trading
- Test thoroughly before going live
- Use small position sizes
- Monitor closely
- Understand exchange fees
- Have proper risk management

## Advanced Features

### Custom Trading Pairs

## Advanced Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customise base currencies:

```python

### Backtesting

```bash
python backtest.py
```

Simulates trading on recent market data to evaluate strategy performance.

### Multi-Exchange Arbitrage

While this version focuses on single-exchange triangular arbitrage, the architecture can be extended for cross-exchange arbitrage.
